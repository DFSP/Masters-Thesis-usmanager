### To build this service

#### Dependencies
```
go get -u github.com/FiloSottile/gvt
gvt restore
```

#### Go tools
In order to build the project locally you need to make sure that the repository directory is located in the correct
$GOPATH directory: $GOPATH/src/github.com/usmanager/manager/request-location-monitor/. Once that is in place you can build by running:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/usmanager/manager/request-location-monitor/cmd/
go build -o request-location-monitor
```

The result is a binary named `request-location-monitor`, in the current directory.

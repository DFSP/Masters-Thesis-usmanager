# Nginx load balancer API
API to add new servers to Nginx load balancer and generate new config files


### To build this service

#### Dependencies
```
go get -u github.com/FiloSottile/gvt
gvt restore
```

#### Go tools
In order to build the project locally you need to make sure that the repository directory is located in the correct
$GOPATH directory: $GOPATH/src/bitbucket.org/cloudedgemicroserviceteam/nginx-load-balancer-api/. Once that is in place you can build by running:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/bitbucket.org/cloudedgemicroserviceteam/nginx-load-balancer-api/cmd/
go build -o nginx-load-balancer-api
```

The result is a binary named `nginx-load-balancer-api`, in the current directory.

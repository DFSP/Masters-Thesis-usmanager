# Registration-client
Register a service on a Eureka server and gets other apps endpoints from Eureka.


### To build this service

#### Dependencies
```
go get -u github.com/FiloSottile/gvt
gvt restore
```

#### Go tools
In order to build the project locally you need to make sure that the repository directory is located in the correct
$GOPATH directory: $GOPATH/src/github.com/usmanager/manager/registration-client/. Once that is in place you can build by running:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/usmanager/manager/registration-client/cmd/registration-client/
go build -o registration-client
```

The result is a binary named `registration-client`, in the current directory.

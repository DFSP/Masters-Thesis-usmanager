Resource optimization of container orchestration: a case study in multi­-cloud microservices-­based applications

Link: TODO

Resumo:
An approach to optimize the deployment of microservices-based applications using
containers in multi-cloud architectures is presented. The optimization objectives are
three: cloud service cost, network latency among microservices, and time to start a
new microservice when a provider becomes unavailable. The decision variables are:
the scale level of the microservices; their allocation in the virtual machines; the
provider and virtual machine type selection; and the number of virtual machines

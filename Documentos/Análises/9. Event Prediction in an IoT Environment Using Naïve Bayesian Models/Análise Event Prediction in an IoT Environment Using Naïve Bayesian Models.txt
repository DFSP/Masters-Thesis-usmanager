Nota: O modelo apresentado teve apenas uma previsão correta em 54% dos casos. A justificação dada foi que o modelo considerado era demasiado simples (A more elaborate model including additional factors such as time of day or season, impacting flight delays could also improve the prediction accuracy.)

Resumo: Architecture that employs a Bayesian event prediction model that uses historical event data generated by the IoT cloud to calculate the probability of future events


1. Introduction

- In many IoT environments event causality is not known, and thus probabilistic approaches must be used to predict the probability of subsequent events occurring, based on the observation of other events.

- In this paper we use the Bayesian approach to probabilistic reasoning 7 , in order to calculate the probability of triggered events occurring based on the probabilities of the occurrence of triggering events

2. Bayesian Networks

- Explicação do uso de Bayesian Networks na previsão de eventos

3. IoT Event Prediction Architecture

- Uso de uma arquitetura onde novos eventos acionam um novo recalculo das probabilidades das dependencias

4. Bayesian Model for Flight Delay Prediction

- We developed a Bayesian event prediction model that calculates the probability of a connecting flight departing late, given the probability of the incoming flight departing late and/or the incoming flight arriving late

5. Case Study

- Uso de dados de voos durante 1 mês

- we observe that the model assigns the highest probability to the correct delay event category in 53.8 % of the cases, which is better than random.

6. Discussion and Conclusions

- A robust event prediction model requires a sufficiently large data set about historical IoT events.

- A more elaborate model including additional factors such as time of day or season, impacting flight delays could also improve the prediction accuracy
